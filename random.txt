HTU is a control-centric block with no data transformation, making it highly amenable to formal verification. Its low sequential depth ensures that formal engines can efficiently explore all possible states, enabling exhaustive verification. This characteristic eliminates the need for extensive stimulus generation and simplifies convergence, making formal the ideal choice for ensuring correctness and robustness in HTUâ€™s functionality.
