Second, we are suggesting an AI-driven method to automate Formal checkers development. Rather than manually writing assertions, assumptions, and coverage properties, verification engineers can submit an input spreadsheet in the form of high-level natural language property descriptions. The AI assistant will then transform the descriptions into complete, functional Formal checkers, which conserve human labor and enhance verification performance.
